# Introduction

This repository contains solutions to various data structure problems. These solutions are implemented in python and java.
My goal was to design the most efficient and optimized solution to common data structure problems.

All the code in this repository was developed during my ramp-up journey to be a better programer.
Contributions to this repository are more than welcome! If you have additional solutions or any feedback to/about existing problems and solutions.

# About

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of a well documented and tested solutions to common data structure and algortihm problems.
Each problem is categoried and organized in a way that make it easy to navigate and understand.

# Languages

All solutions and tests are developed in:

- Python version 3 or above
- Java version 8 or above

# Folder structure

The code in this repository is organized as follow:
